## Welcome to Number Cruncher

I am creating a series of java programs that are being given to me.  If anyone needs to use this code feel free to do so.

## Installation

The only installation you need for this program is to have [Oracle's JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) download which is runable on macOS, Linux and Windows.
